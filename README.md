**Most Java IDEs will allow you to import this repository as a gradle project for compiling it to JavaScript.**

Java must be added to your PATH!

**To compile the web client:**
1. Run `CompileEPK`
2. Run `CompileJS` (or the `generateJavaScript` gradle task in your IDE)
3. Check the "javascript" folder

**To compile an offline download:**
1. Run `CompileEPK`
2. Run `CompileJS` (or the `generateJavaScript` gradle task in your IDE)
3. Run `MakeOfflineDownload`
4. Check the "javascript" folder

**To use the desktop runtime:**
1. Import the Eclipse project in "desktopRuntime/eclipseProject" into your IDE
2. Open one of the .java files from the source folders (workaround for a bug)
3. Run/Debug the client with the included "eaglercraftDebugRuntime" configuration
